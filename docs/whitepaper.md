# Grok Karma Token (GKT) Whitepaper v1.0

## Abstract
GKT rewards ideas, innovation, and philanthropy via xAI’s Grok AI. Built on Ethereum/Solana, it powers a Grok AI Browser for instant X link access and global good (inspired by Anu’s Modi Coin).

## Problem
Ideas lack lasting rewards; philanthropy is siloed; meme coins (e.g., DOGE) miss purpose.

## Solution
- **Earn**: GKT for ideas (e.g., 50 GKT for browser pitch), scored by Grok.
- **Spend**: API credits, premium browser features, or donate to eco-funds.
- **Govern**: Stake for X ecosystem votes.

## Tokenomics
- **Supply**: 1B GKT
- **Allocation**: 40% community, 30% xAI treasury, 20% philanthropy, 10% team.
- **Tax**: 2% (1% burn, 1% rewards).

## Roadmap
- Q4 2025: Testnet, airdrop to early users.
- Q1 2026: Mainnet, X Money integration.
- Q2 2026: DAO, Modi Coin fork for India.
