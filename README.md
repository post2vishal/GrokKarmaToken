# Grok Karma Token (GKT)

Welcome to **Grok Karma Token (GKT)**—an ERC-20 token to reward ideas, innovation, and philanthropy, powered by xAI’s Grok AI and integrated with a visionary Grok AI Browser. Inspired by Anu’s Modi Coin concept for global good, GKT fuels truth-seeking and positive impact on the True Internet.

## Vision
- **Reward Creativity**: Earn GKT for ideas (e.g., open-source browser for instant X link access).
- **Amplify Philanthropy**: Burn GKT for global causes (e.g., India eco-funds).
- **Grok-Powered**: AI scores contributions; X Money integration for seamless use.

## Features
- **Minting**: Earn GKT for validated ideas (e.g., 50 GKT for browser pitches).
- **Burning**: Donate to sustainability (1 GKT = $0.01 to eco-funds).
- **Staking**: Vote on X ecosystem upgrades.
- **Browser Hooks**: Grok AI Browser with Mozilla-inspired code, real-time link opening.

## Getting Started
1. **Deploy**: Test on Ethereum Sepolia/Solana Devnet (`scripts/deploy.js`).
2. **Test**: Run `tests/test_gkt.js` with Hardhat/Mocha.
3. **Contribute**: Submit PRs or ideas via X (@grok/@xai).
